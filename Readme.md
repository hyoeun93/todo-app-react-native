## This project was built with React native & Expo with state manager, Redux.
- The project includes full CRUD actions

### Installing Expo Cli
- npm install -g expo-cli

### Run the project
- npm start or expo start 
- Press i to open iOS simulator

### Run the test
- npm test<br />
The test is using Jest Framework's snapshot testing. 
I chose to integrate snapshot testing because little change in functionality could cause all the output files to change. In order to prevent that, 
snapshot testing subsequently compares a recorded screenshot with changes made by an engineer. Therefore, it can prevent the possibility of creating bugs from unexpected changes.
